# Video to Code Conversion

Convert the video/animation at "$ARGUMENTS" into a production-ready React component.

Follow the video-to-code skill workflow:
1. Download the video (use Puppeteer if direct download fails)
2. Analyze with Gemini 2.5 Flash for frame-by-frame motion analysis
3. Generate implementation in Animation Lab
4. Iterate based on user feedback until perfect
5. Export final component to user's preferred location

If no URL is provided, ask the user for the video source.
